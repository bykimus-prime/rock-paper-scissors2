# rock-paper-scissors2

This is a continuation of the project for rock paper scissors. The goal this time is to make a UI where players click on buttons instead of typing their answer in the prompt. Players will also see a running score and the other elements of the game on the webpage rather than having to go into the browser developer console. This project showcases DOM manipulation and the use of events to get the desired outcomes.
